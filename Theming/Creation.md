# Creating a custom theme

### Setting up

To create a custom theme we need to follow the below process

1. In project directory create new folder under `web/themes/custom/` name it.
2. Under it **.info.yml** file is created such a way project detects the theme.
        The file contains

```yml
name: Simple college theme                          # Name of the theme
type: theme                                         # Type representing as theme
description: "A test theme for my college website"  # A simple description
core_version_requirement: ^9 || ^10 || ^11          # The version on drupal core required
core: ^10                                           # Best works on which drupal version
base theme: stark                                   # This theme depends on which theme
```

### Adding regions to block layout

now it is time to add the regions to the theme just like above create new pair like below
```yml
regions:
    NAME: VALUE
    NAME1: VALUE1
```
and so on.

Flush the cache and enable all the disabled blocks from the block layout menu.

Changes the regions accordingly to our website needs

Now our new regions are visible in the Block Layout menu.

Then I cloned a **./templates/page.html.twig** file from the inbuilt theme and made some changes to display our all regions defined in our **.info.yml** file.




<!--
### Adding libraries

1. Define asset library in <em>.libraries.yml</em>.
2. Declare assets into **.info.yml** using libraries key.
3. Reference as needed in *.css* and *.html.twig* files.

### Overriding the settings

To override the default **settings.php** file from **web/sites/default/settings.php** we need to create the **settings.local.php** file in the same directory and load it at the very bottom of our main **settings.php** file such a way it takes full effect and nothing gets overriden by default settings.

```php
if (file_exists($app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php')) {
  include $app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php';
}
```

and from that local php settings file uncomment the **Disable the render cache.** and **Disable Dynamic Page Cache.** such a way page directly gets loaded from HTML twig files and not from the cache. <br>
In short there is no need to **Flush cache** every time we make changes to the codebase.


### Overriding services.yml

Similarly **web/sites/default/default.services.yml** file gets overriden by **web/sites/development.services.yml** so we can add properties to this file such a way defaults gets overriden.

added below lines

```yml
parameters:
  twig.config:
    debug: true # outputs some extram markup along with each twig template also we can use inspect option
    auto_reload: true
    cache: false
```


Render caching disabled and twig debug mode enabled.

At final rebuild the cache from now on there is no need of the same.

### Fields in the theme

Create **theme-settings.php** file in the **custom/simplecollege** folder.

Adds a section "Simple College Theme Settings" in the Appearance â†’ Theme Settings page.
Creates:

    Checkbox for enabling a custom logo.
    Text field for a custom footer message.

Saves the settings when the form is submitted.

before it was like below having default fields for our custom theme.

and now we can see two new options are there which we have added to the php file.

We need hooks for the implementation of the same.
