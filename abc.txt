B) No authentication is usually needed if the content is accessible to anonymous users. C) Basic Authentication. D) API Key.

If your headless application needs to perform authenticated actions (e.g., creating content, accessing unpublished drafts) on behalf of a user, which is a common and secure authentication method? A) Sending username and password with every request. B) Using Drupal's session cookie (suitable if frontend and backend are on the same parent domain and for server-side requests from Next.js). C) OAuth 2.0 (e.g., using Simple OAuth module) for token-based authentication, especially for third-party clients or decoupled frontends on different domains. D) Hardcoding admin credentials in the frontend.

What is a common approach for a Next.js application to handle authentication with a Drupal backend using OAuth 2.0? A) The Next.js app requests an access token from Drupal's OAuth server, stores it securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookie or backend session), and includes it in subsequent API requests as a Bearer token. B) The Next.js app directly modifies the Drupal users table. C) Drupal automatically trusts any request from the Next.js domain. D) By using Drupal's built-in session cookies without any special handling.

Using JSON:API with Next.js (data fetching, SSR, SSG)
In Next.js, which data fetching function would you typically use within a page component to fetch data from Drupal's JSON:API at request time for Server-Side Rendering (SSR)? A) useEffect() B) getServerSideProps() C) getStaticProps() D) componentDidMount()

If you want to pre-render pages at build time using data from Drupal (Static Site Generation - SSG) in Next.js, which function is primarily used? A) getServerSideProps() B) getStaticPaths() (for dynamic routes) and getStaticProps() (for fetching data for each path) C) fetch() directly in the component body. D) useEffect() with an empty dependency array.

When fetching data from Drupal's JSON:API in a Next.js application, what JavaScript function is commonly used to make the HTTP request? A) XMLHttpRequest B) jQuery.ajax() C) The native fetch() API or libraries like axios. D) drupal_http_request() (This is a Drupal PHP function).

Building menus and navigation in headless apps
How can menu data from Drupal be exposed to a headless Next.js application via JSON:API? A) Menus are not exposable via JSON:API by default. B) The JSON:API module automatically exposes menu items if they are treated as entities or if a module like "JSON:API Menu Items" is used. C) By manually creating a custom REST endpoint for menus. D) Both B and C are common approaches.

Once menu data (e.g., a list of links with titles and URLs) is fetched in Next.js, how is it typically rendered? A) It's automatically rendered by Next.js. B) By mapping over the array of menu items and rendering Next.js <Link> components or standard <a> tags. C) Using a special Drupal JavaScript library. D) By embedding an iframe of the Drupal menu.

For nested menus (hierarchical), what kind of data structure would you expect from Drupal's JSON:API (perhaps with help from JSON:API Menu Items or similar)? A) A flat list of all menu items, requiring client-side reconstruction of the hierarchy. B) A nested structure where child items are included within their parent items, or relationships that allow reconstruction. C) An HTML string representing the menu. D) A single string with all menu links concatenated.

Image/media handling via JSON:API
When you fetch a Media entity (e.g., an Image) via JSON:API, how do you typically get the actual URL to the image file? A) The URL is always the main self link of the media entity. B) The JSON:API response for the media entity will include a field (often within attributes or a relationship to the file entity) that contains the URL to the image file, potentially with image style derivatives. C) You need to guess the URL based on the media entity's ID. D) The image is embedded as a base64 string in the JSON.

How can you request a specific image style derivative (e.g., "thumbnail," "large") for an image via JSON:API? A) This is not possible; only the original image is available. B) The JSON:API response for an image media entity (or its referenced file entity) often includes URLs for available image styles, or you might need a module like Consumer Image Styles to easily access them. C) By appending ?style=thumbnail to the main API endpoint. D) By using a different API endpoint for each image style.

If your Next.js app needs to display responsive images using different image style derivatives from Drupal, what's a common approach? A) Fetch all image styles and use JavaScript to switch them. B) Fetch data that includes URLs for multiple image styles, then use the HTML <picture> element or srcset attribute in an <img> tag in your Next.js components. C) Drupal automatically handles responsive images for headless frontends. D) Only use the original image and let CSS resize it.

Creating custom API endpoints (custom routes and controllers)
If JSON:API doesn't provide data in the exact format or aggregation you need for your Next.js app, what is a common Drupal solution? A) Modify the JSON:API module's core code. B) Create a custom module in Drupal with custom routes and controllers that return JSON responses tailored to your needs (often using the RESTful Web Services module or just returning JsonResponse). C) Try to manipulate the data extensively on the Next.js client-side. D) Switch to a different CMS.

When creating a custom API endpoint in a Drupal controller to return JSON, what type of Response object should your controller method typically return? A) \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response with HTML content. B) \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse. C) \Drupal\Core\Render\HtmlResponse. D) A plain PHP array.

How do you define the path for your custom API endpoint? A) In the module_name.info.yml file. B) In a module_name.routing.yml file, similar to defining routes for regular pages. C) It's automatically generated based on the controller name. D) In the composer.json file.

Decoupled blocks and views
Can Drupal Blocks be easily consumed by a headless application via the standard JSON:API module? A) Yes, blocks are exposed as top-level resources by default. B) Not directly as "rendered blocks." You would typically fetch the content that populates a block (e.g., a custom block entity, or the results of a View that a block might display) and reconstruct its presentation in the frontend. C) Only if the "JSON:API Blocks" module is installed. D) Blocks can only be rendered through Twig.

How can the data from a Drupal View be exposed for a headless application? A) Views cannot be used in a headless setup. B) By creating a "REST export" display in the View, which can output data in formats like JSON (this uses the RESTful Web Services module, not directly JSON:API for the View itself, though JSON:API can fetch entities listed by a View). C) The JSON:API module automatically creates endpoints for all Views. D) By taking a screenshot of the View and displaying it as an image.

If a View is configured with a REST export display, what does the Next.js application typically fetch? A) The rendered HTML of the View. B) A JSON (or other configured format) representation of the View's results (rows of data). C) The View's configuration YAML. D) A Twig template for the View.

Entity access and permissions in APIs
When JSON:API serves entity data, does it respect Drupal's entity access permissions? A) No, JSON:API bypasses all access checks for performance. B) Yes, JSON:API (and Drupal's REST system in general) integrates with the entity access system, so users (including anonymous or authenticated API clients) will only see data they are permitted to access. C) Only if explicitly configured per entity type. D) Access permissions are only relevant for the Drupal admin UI.

If an anonymous user tries to fetch an unpublished node via JSON:API, what is the expected outcome? A) The unpublished node data is returned. B) A 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found error, as anonymous users typically don't have permission to view unpublished content. C) A 500 server error. D) The API returns a placeholder for the unpublished content.

For operations like creating or updating entities via JSON:API (e.g., POST, PATCH requests), what is crucial? A) The API client must be authenticated with a user account that has the necessary permissions (e.g., "Article: Create new content", "Article: Edit own content"). B) No special permissions are needed for write operations via API. C) The X-Admin-Override header must be sent. D) These operations are disabled by default in JSON:API.
